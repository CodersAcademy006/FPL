üìö C Programming Project Repository
===================================

### üî∞ **Project Overview**

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of **C programs** developed in accordance with the syllabus of **Savitribai Phule Pune University**. Each program addresses a specific problem statement, utilizing fundamental programming concepts such as arrays, pointers, file handling, and string manipulation. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in C programming through a series of structured solutions, organized into distinct folders for easy navigation.

While the project is based on the core syllabus requirements, it has been extended to include additional practice problems and solutions to provide a deeper understanding of C programming. As the project is still **ongoing**, more miscellaneous questions and advanced programs will be added in subsequent iterations.
